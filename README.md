# Introduction

To run your code in cloud you need to do three things:

- **Create code package**
- **Upload code package**
- **Queue or schedule tasks** for execution

While you can use [REST APIs](http://dev.iron.io/worker/reference/api) for that, it's easier to use an
IronWorker library created specifically for your language of choice, such as this gem, IronWorkerNG.

# Preparing Your Environment

You'll need to register at http://iron.io/ and get your credentials to use IronWorkerNG. Each account can have an unlimited number of projects, so take advantage of it by creating separate projects for development, testing and production. Each project is identified by a unique project ID and requires your access token before it will perform any action, like uploading or queuing workers.

Also, you'll need a Ruby 1.9 interpreter and the IronWorkerNG gem. Install it using following command.

```sh
gem install iron_worker_ng
```

# Creating A Worker

Each IronWorkerNG Ruby worker is just Ruby code. It can be as simple or as complex as you want. For example,
the following is an acceptable worker:

```ruby
puts "Hello Worker!"
puts "My task_id is #{@iron_worker_task_id}"
puts "I got '#{params}' parameters"
```

All output to `STDOUT` will be logged and available for your review when your worker finishes execution.

# Creating The Code Package

Before you can run use IronWorker, be sure you've [created a free account with Iron.io](http://www.iron.io)
and [setup your Iron.io credentials on your system](http://dev.iron.io/articles/configuration/) (either in a json
file or using ENV variables). You only need to do that once for your machine. If you've done that, then you can continue.

Since our worker will be executed in the cloud, you'll need to bundle all the necessary gems,
supplementary data, and other dependencies with it. `.worker` files make it easy to define your worker.

```ruby
# define the runtime language, this can be ruby, java, node, php, go, etc.
runtime "ruby"
# exec is the file that will be executed:
exec "hello_worker.rb"
```

You can read more about `.worker` files here: http://dev.iron.io/worker/reference/dotworker/

## Uploading the Code Package

If your .worker file is called `hello.worker`, then run:

    iron_worker upload hello

This will upload your worker with the name "hello" so you can reference it like that when queuing up tasks for it.

## Queue Up a Task for your Worker

You can quicky queue up a task for your worker from the command line using:

    iron_worker queue hello

Use the `-p` parameter to pass in a payload:

    iron_worker queue hello -p "{\"hi\": \"world\"}"

Most commonly you'll be queuing up tasks from code though, so you can do this:

```ruby
require "iron_worker_ng"
client = IronWorkerNG::Client.new
100.times do
   client.tasks.create("hello", "foo"=>"bar")
end
```
### Debugging

To get a bunch of extra output to debug things, turn it on using:

    IronCore::Logger.logger.level = ::Logger::DEBUG


## IronWorkerNG::Code::Base API

The IronWorkerNG::Code::Base class will help you package your code for upload, but to upload it to the cloud, you'll need to use the `IronWorkerNG::Client` class.

### initialize(*args)

Create new code package with the specified args.

```ruby
code_from_workerfile = IronWorkerNG::Code::Base.new(:workerfile => 'example.worker')
code_with_name = IronWorkerNG::Code::Base.new(:exec => 'example.rb', :name => 'Example')
code_with_guessed_name = IronWorkerNG::Code::Base.new(:exec => 'example.rb')
code = IronWorkerNG::Code::Base.new
```

### runtime()

Return the code package's runtime.

```ruby
puts code.runtime
```

### runtime=(runtime)

Sets the code package's runtime. If no runtime provided it defaults to 'ruby'.

```ruby
code.runtime = 'ruby'
```

### name()

Return the code package's name.

```ruby
puts code.name
```

### name=(name)

Sets the code package's name.

```ruby
code.name = 'CoolWorker'
```

### remote_build_command(cmd)
### build(cmd)

Command which will be executed once (on worker upload). Can be used for heavy tasks like building your worker from sources. Check https://github.com/iron-io/iron_worker_examples/tree/master/binary/phantomjs for real world example.

```ruby
code.remote_build_command('curl http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v3.0/linux-3.4.6.tar.bz2 -o linux-3.4.6.tar.bz2 && tar xf linux-3.4.6.tar.bz2')
```

### run()

Runs code package on your local box. Can be useful for testing.

```ruby
code.run
```

### hash_string()

Return the hash string for the code package. If you want to prevent uploading unchanged code packages, you can use it to check if any changes were made. It's very efficient, so it shouldn't cause any performance impact.

```
puts code.hash_string
```

### merge_file(path, dest = '')
### file(path, dest = '')

Merge the file located at `path` into the code package. If `dest` is set, it will be used as the path to a directory within the zip, into which the file will be merged. If the directory does not exist, it will be automatically created.

```ruby
code.merge_file '../config/database.yml' # will be in the same directory as worker
code.merge_file 'clients.csv', 'information/clients' # will be in information/clients subdirectory
```

### merge_dir(path, dest = '')
### dir(path, dest = '')

Recursively merge the directory located at path into the code package. If `dest` is set, it will be used as the path to a directory within the zip, into which the directory specified by `path` will be merged. If `dest` is set but does not exist, it will be automatically created.

```ruby
code.merge_dir '../config' # will be in the same directory as worker
code.merge_dir 'lib', 'utils' # will be in utils subdirectory, accessible as utils/lib
```

## IronWorkerNG::Code::Ruby API

Specific methods for ruby runtime.

### merge_exec(path, klass = nil)
### exec(path, klass = nil)

Merge the exec located at `path`. If `klass` is provided, it'll try to instantiate it, set attrs from params and fire up `run` method when executed.

```ruby
code.merge_exec 'my_worker.rb'
```

### merge_gem(name, version = '>= 0')
### gem(name, version = '>= 0')

Merge a gem with dependencies. Please note that gems which contains binary extensions will not be merged for now, as binary extensions are not supported at this time; we have [a set](http://dev.iron.io/worker/reference/environment/?lang=ruby#ruby_gems_installed) of the most common gems with binary extensions preinstalled for your use. You can use version constrains if you need a specific gem version. Please note that `git` and `path` gems aren't supported yet.

```ruby
code.merge_gem 'activerecord'
code.merge_gem 'paperclip', '< 3.0.0,>= 2.1.0'
```

### merge_gemfile(path, *groups)
### gemfile(path, *groups)

Merge all gems from specified the groups in a Gemfile. Please note that this will not auto-require the gems when executing the worker.

```ruby
code.merge_gemfile '../Gemfile', 'common', 'worker' # merges gems from common and worker groups
```

## IronWorkerNG::Code::Binary API

# Upload Your Worker

When you have your code package, you are ready to upload and run it on the IronWorker cloud.

```ruby
# Initialize the client
client = IronWorkerNG::Client.new(:token => 'IRON_IO_TOKEN', :project_id => 'IRON_IO_PROJECT_ID')
# Upload the code
client.codes.create(code)
```

**NOTE**: You only need to call `client.codes.create(code)` once for each time your code changes.

# Queue Up Tasks for Your Worker

Now that the code is uploaded, we can create/queue up tasks. You can call this over and over
for as many tasks as you want.

```ruby
client.tasks.create('MyWorker', {:client => 'Joe'})
```
