# HelloWorker Example

This is the simplest example you can find and is a great place to start. It simply logs some output
to the worker log.

1. Be sure you've setup your Iron.io credentials, see main [README.md](https://github.com/iron-io/iron_worker_examples).
2. Run `iron_worker upload hello` to upload the worker code package to IronWorker.
3. Run `ruby enqueue.rb` to queue up a task.
4. Look at [HUD](https://hud.iron.io) to view your tasks running, check logs, etc.
