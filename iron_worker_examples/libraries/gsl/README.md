The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) is a numerical library for C and C++ programmers. It is free software under the GNU General Public License.

The library provides a wide range of mathematical routines such as random number generators, special functions and least-squares fitting. There are over 1000 functions in total with an extensive test suite.

The complete range of subject areas covered by the library includes,

Complex Numbers Roots of Polynomials
Special Functions Vectors and Matrices
Permutations  Sorting
BLAS Support  Linear Algebra
Eigensystems  Fast Fourier Transforms
Quadrature  Random Numbers
Quasi-Random Sequences  Random Distributions
Statistics  Histograms
N-Tuples  Monte Carlo Integration
Simulated Annealing Differential Equations
Interpolation Numerical Differentiation
Chebyshev Approximation Series Acceleration
Discrete Hankel Transforms  Root-Finding
Minimization  Least-Squares Fitting
Physical Constants  IEEE Floating-Point
Discrete Wavelet Transforms Basis splines
Unlike the licenses of proprietary numerical libraries the license of GSL does not restrict scientific cooperation. It allows you to share your programs freely with others.
