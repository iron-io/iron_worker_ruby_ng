# Ruby Next Generation

Ruby NG stands for "Ruby Next Generation". It's our second generation Ruby gem that makes various things easier and more efficient,
such as including the proper libraries with your workers.

    sudo gem install iron_worker_ng

**Warning**: This gem is new and the documentation is not as complete as our original Ruby Gem, which is still fully
supported and used.
